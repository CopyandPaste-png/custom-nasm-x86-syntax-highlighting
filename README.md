# NASM x86 syntax highlighting

This extention has a theme which makes nasm x86 syntax highlighting look better.

It does require you to change your VSCODE's color theme to "nasm x86"

You do this by:
* Click setting icon on the bottom left
* Click "color theme"
* Choose "nasm x86"

The other extention i wrote uses default VSCODE colours.
